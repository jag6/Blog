If anyone else encountered problems with this tutorial, it's due to the updates and changes in mongoose. 

1. I had to put my variable "marked" inside of curly braces in order to work properly:
The tutorial version:
const marked = require('marked') 
threw an error
I fixed it this way:
const { marked } = require('marked')

2. "CastError: Cast to ObjectId failed for value "made-from-iphone" (type string) at path "_id" for model "Article"
If you encountered this problem, 
go to your [articles.js] file, search for this:

router.get('/edit/:id', async (req, res) => {

    const article = await Article.findById(req.params.id)
    res.render('articles/edit', {article: article})
})




and change the findById to findOneAndUpdate

router.get('/edit/:id', async (req, res) => {

    const article = await Article.findOneAndUpdate(req.params.id)
    res.render('articles/edit', {article: article})
})
